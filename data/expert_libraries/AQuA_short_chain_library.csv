AQuA,Roberts has a property worth of $1023.65. But in a record his property worth is written as greatest positive even integer less than or equal to his property worth and it is divisible by 100. Find the difference between actual property and recorded property worth?,"{'A': 'A)23.65', 'B': 'B)1000', 'C': 'C)35.62', 'D': 'D)2.65', 'E': 'E)1023.65'}","Let's think this through step by step, but keep it brief.","Sure! Here's the solution: Let's analyze the given information: 1. The property worth is $1023.65. 2. In the record, the property worth is written as the greatest positive even integer less than or equal to the actual property worth and divisible by 100. Now, let's think about the possible values that could be recorded: 1. The greatest positive even integer less than or equal to $1023.65 is $1000. 2. $1000 is divisible by 100. Therefore, the recorded property worth is $1000. So, the difference between the actual and recorded property worth is: $1023.65 - $1000 = $23.65 The correct answer is option 'A': $23.65.",A,A,True,short_chain,2
