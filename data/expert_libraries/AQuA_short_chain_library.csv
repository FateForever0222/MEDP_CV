AQuA,"A shopkeeper employed a servant at a monthly salary of 1500. In addition to it, he agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000?","{'A': 'A)30000', 'B': 'B)415000', 'C': 'C)31500', 'D': 'D)50000', 'E': 'E)None of these'}","Let's think this through step by step, but keep it brief.","Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

The shopkeeper agreed to pay the servant a monthly salary of 1500 and a commission of 15% on the monthly sale.

So, if the servant wants his monthly income to be 6000, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

Monthly salary + Commission = Monthly Income

1500 + (15% of Monthly Sale) = 6000

Now, we need to find out what the monthly sale should be so that the servant's monthly income is 6000.

We can start by calculating the commission:

Commission = 15% of Monthly Sale
= 15/100 x Monthly Sale

Now, we can substitute the values we know:

Monthly Salary + Commission = Monthly Income

1500 + (15/100 x Monthly Sale) = 6000

We want the monthly income to be 6000, so we can set up an equation:

1500 + (15/100 x 6000) = 6000

Now, we can simplify the equation:

1500 + (15/100 x 6000) = 6000

1500 + 900 = 6000

2400 = 6000

So, the monthly sale should be:

Monthly Sale = 6000 / 100
= 60 x 100
= 6000","the correct answer is option C: 31500.

The servant should do a monthly sale of 31500 to earn a monthly income of 6000.",A,False,short_chain,1
AQuA,"A student instead of finding the value of 7/8 of a number, found the value of 7/18 of the number. If his answer differed from the actual one by 770, find the that number.","{'A': 'A)1584', 'B': 'B)2520', 'C': 'C)1728', 'D': 'D)1656', 'E': 'E)None'}","Let's think this through step by step, but keep it brief.","Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step:

Given that the student found the value of 7/18 of a number, we know that the actual value of 7/8 of the number is incorrect.

Let's call the number ""x"". Then, we can write:

7/8 = (7/18) x

Since the student found the value of 7/18 to be y, we have:

(7/18) x = y

Now, we know that the actual value of 7/8 is 770 away from the student's answer. So, we can write:

(7/8) x - y = 770

Simplifying this equation, we get:

4x - 7y = 770

Now, we need to find the value of x that satisfies this equation. To do so, we can solve for x by adding 7y to both sides of the equation:

4x - 7y + 7y = 770 + 7y

This simplifies to:

4x = 840

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to find x:

x = 210",the correct answer is option C (1728).,A,False,short_chain,1

Here's the solution:

The total length of the fence is the sum of the lengths of all the pickets. Since each picket is 1/2 inch wide, the length of each picket is 1/2 inch.","the total length of the fence is:

1/2 inch x x = 13x/2 (option A)

There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, so we need to add this to the length of each picket:

We can simplify this by combining like terms:

13x/2 + 6 = 13x/2 + 6 (option C)

There are 24 inches in a foot, so we can convert the fraction to an integer:

13x/2 + 6 = 13x/24 + 6 (option D)

We can simplify the expression by combining like terms:

= n2 + 2n + 32 / (n + 4n + 16)

Now, we can see that the numerator and denominator have a common factor of n, so we can cancel it out:

= n(n + 2 + 32) / (n + 4n + 16)

= n(n + 32) / (2n + 16)

Here's the solution:

Let's say one number is x and the other number is y.

We know that the difference between their squares is 256000:

x^2 - y^2 = 256000 ... (1)

Since the sum of the two numbers is 1000, we can write:

x + y = 1000 ... (2)

Now, let's substitute (2) into (1):

x^2 - y^2 = 256000

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

x^2 = 384000 + y^2

Since x and y are both positive integers, we know that x^2 and y^2 must both be non-negative.","we can conclude that:

x^2 = 384000 + y^2 >= 384000

Simplifying further, we get:

x^2 >= 384000

Since x is a positive integer, we know that x^2 must be an even number. Therefore, we can conclude that:

x^2 = 2^n * 3^m

where n and m are integers. Substituting this into the previous inequality, we get:

2^n * 3^m >= 384000

Simplifying further, we get:

n + m >= 19

Since n and m are both integers, we know that n + m must be an integer. Therefore, the only possible solution is:

n = 18
m = 2

Here's the solution:

To find out how many meters of fencing Alice needs, we need to first find out the perimeter of the yard. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of the yard. To do this, we add up the lengths of all four sides.

Since three sides are being fenced in, we only need to worry about one side that is not being fenced in (the 10-meter side). So, the perimeter of the yard is:

Perimeter = 2(longest side) + 1(shortest side)
= 2(10) + 1(?)
= 20 + 1
= 21 meters

Now that we have the perimeter, we can find out how much fencing Alice needs by dividing the perimeter by the length of one section of fencing. Let's assume that each section of fencing is 2 meters long (this is a common length for fencing).

Fencing needed = Perimeter / Length of one section of fencing

Let's work through this problem together.

First, we know that 10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective, so we can assume that 10% of 4,000 staplers (the total number produced) were defective. This means that 400 staplers were defective (10% of 4,000).

Next, we know that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Since there were 3,600 non-defective staplers (4,000 - 400), 2% of them were rejected, which is 72 staplers (2% of 3,600).

Now, we need to find out how many staplers were produced in total. We know that the number of defective staplers is 400, and the number of non-defective staplers rejected was 72. So, the total number of staplers produced on Monday is:

The semi-perimeter of a room is equal to half the perimeter of the room. Since the height of the room is given as 2.5 times its semi-perimeter, we can set up the equation:

Height = 2.5 x Semi-Perimeter

We know that the semi-perimeter is given by:

Semi-Perimeter = 2(length + width)

where length and width are the dimensions of the room. Since the paper costs Rs.2 per meter, we know that the length and width of the room must be multiples of 0.5 meters (since Rs.2 x 0.5 = Rs.1).","we can set up the equation:

Height = 2.5 x (2(length + width))

Simplifying, we get:

Height = 2.5 x 2(length + width)

= 2.5 x 2(0.5 length + 0.5 width)

= 2.5 x 2(0.5) x (length + width)

= 2.5 x 2 x (length + width)

= 5 x (length + width)

Now we know that the height of the room is 5 times the sum of its length and width. Since the length and width are both multiples of 0.5 meters, we can write:

Height = 5 x (0.5 length + 0.5 width)

= 5 x (0.5) x (length + width)

= 2.5 x (length + width)

Simplifying, we get:

Height = 2.5(length + width)

Now we can choose the correct option based on the given information. The area of the room is given as 15 sq.m, so we know that the length and width must be multiples of 3 meters (since 3 x 3 = 9, and 9 + 6 = 15).

Therefore, we can set up the equation:

Length + Width = 3(3)

= 3 x 3

= 9

Since the length and width are both equal to 3 meters, we can write:

3. Since neither of them won or lost any amount after flipping the coin for 20 times, we can conclude that the coin landed on heads exactly half the number of times (i.e., 10 times).",the correct answer is option A: 10.,E,False,short_chain,3
AQuA,"At my favorite fruit stand, an orange costs 18 dollars, a pineapple costs 27 dollars, and a grape costs 15 dollars. Using the same logic, can you tell how much a mango costs?","{'A': 'A)22 dollars', 'B': 'B)15 dollars', 'C': 'C)20 dollars', 'D': 'D)18 dollars', 'E': 'E)10 dollars'}","Let's think this through step by step, but keep it brief.","Sure! Here's the solution:

The pattern in the prices is: each fruit costs $3 more than the previous one.

So, if an orange costs $18, a pineapple costs $27 (=$18 + $3), and a grape costs $15 ($18 - $3).","a mango would cost $22 ($18 + $3).

The correct answer is option A: $22.",B,False,short_chain,3
