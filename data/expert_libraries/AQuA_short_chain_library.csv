AQuA,"The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?","{'A': 'A)$61', 'B': 'B)$65', 'C': 'C)$67.40', 'D': 'D)$70', 'E': 'E)$78.20'}","Let's think this through step by step, but keep it brief.","Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step: 1. First, we know that the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item. So, let's find half the original price: Half of $x (the original price) = $1.90, where x is the original price. Solving for x, we get: x = $3.80 (since $1.90 is 50% of $3.80). 2. Next, we know that the customer used a $20-off coupon, so we need to subtract $20 from the original price: $3.80 - $20 = $1.80 3. Finally, we know that the customer paid this amount minus the $1.90 they paid more than half the original price: $1.80 - $1.90 = $0.90 So, the original price of the item was $0.90. Therefore, the correct answer is option A: $61.",A,E,False,short_chain,3

AQuA,"At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day?","{'A': 'A)4,000', 'B': 'B)4,200', 'C': 'C)4,500', 'D': 'D)4,800', 'E': 'E)5,000'}","Let's think this through step by step, but keep it brief.","Sure! Let's work through this problem together. First, we know that 10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective, so we can assume that 10% of 4,000 staplers (the total number produced) were defective. This means that 400 staplers were defective (10% of 4,000). Next, we know that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Since there were 3,600 non-defective staplers (4,000 - 400), 2% of 3,600 is 72 staplers. So, in total, 400 + 72 = 472 staplers were rejected or defective. Now, we need to find out how many non-defective staplers were produced that day. To do this, we subtract the number of defective and rejected staplers from the total number produced: 4,000 - 472 = 3,528 Therefore, the number of non-defective staplers produced on Monday was 3,528. The correct answer is B) 4,200.",B,A,False,short_chain,2

Here's the solution: Let's call the distance between A and B ""d"". 1. Since Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph, he covered d/70 miles in 1 hour. 2. Since he was 70 miles away from B and had 3 hours before the end of his trip, he had traveled for 2 hours (since he started driving at 70 mph). Therefore, he had covered 2 \* d/70 miles. 3. When he turned around and returned to A, he drove at a constant speed of 90 mph. Therefore, he covered the remaining distance (d - 2 \* d/70) / 90 miles in 1 hour. 4. Since he was approaching B only 70 miles away from it when he turned around, d - 2 \* d/70 must be at least 70 miles. 5.

Let's solve this problem step by step: 1. We know that Train A leaves Mumbai Central at 11 am and travels at a speed of 40 kmph. So, it will cover a distance of: Distance = Speed x Time = 40 kmph x 5 hours (to Lucknow) = 200 km 2. We know that Train B leaves Mumbai Central at 2 pm and travels at a speed of 72 kmph. So, it will cover a distance of: Distance = Speed x Time = 72 kmph x 3 hours (to Lucknow) = 216 km Note that Train B covers more distance than Train A because it travels at a higher speed. 3. Now, we need to find when the two trains will meet each other. We know that Train A starts at 11 am and Train B starts at 2 pm, so they will meet each other after Train B has started. Let's calculate the time: Time = Distance / Speed = 216 km / 72 kmph = 3 hours So, the two trains will meet each other after 3 hours from the start of Train B, which is at 5 pm (2 pm + 3 hours).

Let's work through this problem together. First, we know that the company produces very fine quality writing pens, and on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective, so they are rejected before packing. This means that out of every 100 pens produced, 10 pens will be defective, and the company will not sell those pens. Second, we know that the company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. This means that the total revenue from selling all 7200 pens will be: 7200 x Rs. 10 = Rs. 72,000 Third, we know that the overall profit on all the manufactured pens is 25%. This means that the total profit from selling all 7200 pens will be: 25% of Rs. 72,000 = Rs. 18,000 Now, we need to find out the manufacturing cost per pen so that we can calculate the profit per pen. We know that the company produces 7200 pens, and the total profit from selling all pens is Rs. 18,000. So, if we divide the total profit by the number of pens produced, we can find out the manufacturing cost per pen: Rs. 18,000 / 7200 = Rs. 2.50 Therefore, the manufactured cost per pen is Rs. 2.50.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z. 1. First, we know that alloy X is made of 6 parts zinc and 9 parts copper, so the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy X is 6:9 or 2:3. 2. Next, we know that alloy Y is made of 7 parts zinc and 11 parts copper, so the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Y is 7:11 or 3:4. 3. When we mix 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y, we have a total of 100 grams of alloy Z. 4. Since the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy X is 2:3 and the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Y is 3:4, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z will be a weighted average of these two ratios. 5. To find the weighted average, we need to calculate the proportion of each metal in the mixture. Let's do this by dividing the total weight of each metal by the total weight of the mixture: Proportion of zinc in alloy X = 6/40 = 1/7 Proportion of copper in alloy X = 9/40 = 2/7 Proportion of zinc in alloy Y = 7/60 = 1/9 Proportion of copper in alloy Y = 11/60 = 3/9 Now we can calculate the weighted average of the ratios: Weighted average ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z = (1/7 x 2) + (1/9 x 3) = 2/7 + 3/9 = 5/16 = 3/8 Therefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 3:8 or option C.",C,B,False,short_chain,3

Using the same logic, can you tell how much a mango costs?","{'A': 'A)22 dollars', 'B': 'B)15 dollars', 'C': 'C)20 dollars', 'D': 'D)18 dollars', 'E': 'E)10 dollars'}","Let's think this through step by step, but keep it brief.","Sure! Here's the solution: The pattern in the prices is: each fruit costs $3 more than the previous one. So, if an orange costs $18, a pineapple costs $27 (=$18 + $3), and a grape costs $15 ($18 - $3). Therefore, a mango would cost $22 ($18 + $3). The correct answer is option A: $22.",A,B,False,short_chain,3
