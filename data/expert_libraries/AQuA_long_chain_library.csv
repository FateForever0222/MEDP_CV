Here's the step-by-step analysis of the question:

1. The youngest member of the club is just 7 years old.

So, we know that the ages of all members must be in A.P., and the common difference must be 3 months.

2. The sum of the ages of all the members is 250.

Let's say there are x members in the club, where x is a positive integer.

Since the youngest member is 7 years old, the next member will be 7 + 3 = 10 years old, and so on.

So, the ages of all members can be represented as:

7, 10, 13, ..., x - 3

where x is the number of members in the club.

Now, let's find out the sum of these ages:

7 + 10 + 13 + ... + (x - 3) = 250

Since the common difference is 3 months, we can write:

7 + 10 + 13 + ... + (x - 3) = 250

We can simplify this equation by noticing that each term is 3 months apart:

7 + 10 + 13 + ... + (x - 3) = 250

7 + 10 + 13 + ... + x = 250

Now, we can see that the left-hand side of the equation is an A.P. with a common difference of 3 months, and the right-hand side is equal to 250.

So, we can set up the equation:

7 + 10 + 13 + ... + x = 250

We know that the sum of an A.P. is given by the formula:

n/2(a + l)

where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the common difference.

In this case, n = x, a = 7, and l = 3.

So, we can substitute these values into the equation:

n/2(a + l) = 250

x/2(7 + 3) = 250

x/2(10) = 250

x = 250 x 2 = 500","there are 500 members in the club.

Now, let's check the options:

Option A: 18

No, that's not correct. The sum of the ages of all members is 250, and the youngest member is 7 years old, so none of the members can be 18 years old.

Option B: 20

No, that's not correct either. The sum of the ages of all members is 250, and the youngest member is 7 years old, so none of the members can be 20 years old.

Option C: 25

No, that's not correct either. The sum of the ages of all members is 250, and the youngest member is 7 years old, so none of the members can be 25 years old.

Option D: 26

No, that's not correct either. The sum of the ages of all members is 250, and the youngest member is 7 years old, so none of the members can be 26 years old.

Option E: 27

No, that's not correct either. The sum of the ages of all members is 250, and the youngest member is 7 years old, so none of the members can be 27 years old.

Roberts has a property worth $1023.65.

In a record, his property worth is written as the greatest positive even integer less than or equal to his property worth and it is divisible by 100.

Step 2: Identify the pattern in the given information

From the given information, we can identify that the recorded property worth is always an even integer that is less than or equal to the actual property worth. Additionally, the recorded property worth is always divisible by 100.

Here's the step-by-step analysis of the question:

1. Let's say the number is x.
2. The student found 7/18 of x, which is (7/18)x.
3. We know that the actual value of 7/8 of x is (7/8)x.
4. To find the difference between the two values, we can subtract (7/18)x from (7/8)x:

(7/8)x - (7/18)x = ?

5. We know that the difference is 770, so we can set up an equation:

(7/8)x - (7/18)x = 770

6. Now we can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 8/18:

(7/8)x - (7/18)x = 8(7/18)x

7. Since 7/18 of x is the same as 7/8 of x, we can cancel out the common factor of 7:

(7/8)x - (7/18)x = 8x

8.","the difference between the actual value of 7/8 of x and the student's answer is simply 8x.

9. To find the value of x, we can solve for x in the equation:

There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?","{'A': 'A)$61', 'B': 'B)$65', 'C': 'C)$67.40', 'D': 'D)$70', 'E': 'E)$78.20'}",Let's analyze this in detail step by step.,"Sure, let's work through this problem together! Here are the steps we can follow to solve it:

Step 1: Identify the information given in the problem.

We know that the original price of the item was discounted by 22%, and the customer bought the item using a $20-off coupon. We also know that there is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. Finally, we know that the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item.

Step 2: Use the information from step 1 to set up an equation.

Let's call the original price of the item ""x"". We know that the discounted price of the item is 22% less than x, so we can write:

Discounted price = x - (22% of x)

We also know that the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, so we can write:

Payment = half of x + $1.90

Step 3: Solve for the variable(s).

We have two equations and two unknowns (x and half of x). We can use substitution or elimination to solve for both variables. Let's use substitution.

First, we can solve equation 2 for half of x:

half of x = payment - $1.90

Now, we can substitute this expression into equation 1:

Discounted price = x - (22% of x)

Substituting half of x for x, we get:

Discounted price = half of x - (22% of half of x)

Now we can simplify and solve for x:

x = half of x + (22% of half of x)

x = payment / 2 + $1.90

We know that the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, so we can write:

payment = half of x + $1.90

Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:

x = payment / 2 + $1.90

Now we can solve for x:

x = (payment / 2) + $1.90

x = ($1.90 + payment / 2)

x = ($1.90 + $1.90) / 2

x = ($3.80) / 2

x = $1.90

So, the original price of the item was $1.90.

Step 4: Choose the correct answer from the options given.

Based on our solution, we can see that the correct answer is option B): $65. This is because the discounted price of the item was half of the original price ($1.90), plus the $20-off coupon ($65 - $1.90 = $63.10).",the correct answer is option B): $65.,E,False,long_chain,20

1. A starts a business with Rs.40,000.
2. After 2 months, B joins him with Rs.60,000.
3. C joins them after some more time (we don't know how much time yet).
4. At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find out when C joined the business:

1. We know that A started the business with Rs.40,000, and B joined him after 2 months with Rs.60,000. So, in total, they had Rs.40,000 + Rs.60,000 = Rs.100,000 at the beginning of the business.
2. We also know that C joined them after some more time, and they made a profit of Rs.375,000 at the end of the year. So, the total amount of money they had at the end of the year is:
Rs.100,000 + Rs.375,000 = Rs.475,000.
3. Now, we know that C gets Rs.150,000 as his share of the profit. So, if we subtract his share from the total amount of money they had at the end of the year, we can find out how much money was left with A and B:
Rs.475,000 - Rs.150,000 = Rs.325,000.
4. Since A and B had Rs.100,000 at the beginning of the business, they must have made a profit of Rs.325,000 - Rs.100,000 = Rs.225,000 over the course of the year.
5. Finally, we can use this information to find out when C joined the business:
We know that C gets Rs.150,000 as his share of the profit, and there is a total profit of Rs.375,000 at the end of the year. So, if we divide the total profit by C's share, we can find out how many times C's share fits into the total profit:
Rs.375,000 ÷ Rs.150,000 = 2.5
6. Since there are 12 months in a year, and C joins them after some more time, we can find out how many months after B joined the business C joined by dividing the number of times C's share fits into the total profit by 12:
2.5 ÷ 12 = 0.2083 (or approximately 2 months and 2 weeks)",option B is the correct answer: C joins them after 4 months.,B,True,long_chain,14

This means that Meenu's weight is not directly given, but we know that she weighs more than Silu (51 kg).

3. But she said, ""I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.""

Let's break down this statement:

* ""I weigh 29 Kgs"" means Meenu weighs 29 kg.
* ""plus half of my weight"" means Meenu's weight is not just 29 kg, but it's more than that.

So, Meenu's weight is 29 kg + (half of her weight).

4. To find the correct answer, we need to calculate half of Meenu's weight.

Half of Meenu's weight can be calculated as follows:

* Half of 51 kg = 51 kg / 2 = 25.5 kg (since Meenu weighs 51 kg)

3. The cost of gardening is given as 10 per square meter.
4. We need to find the area of the boundary of the plot, which is equal to the perimeter times the width.

Here's the step-by-step analysis of the question:

1. First, we know that the price of each article decreased by 15%. So, we can calculate the new price of each article as follows:

Original price = $x
New price = x / 0.85 (since 15% is the same as 0.15)

2. Now, we know that Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decrease. So, we can set up an equation based on this information:

5 x New price = $300

3. Substitute the expression for the new price that we derived in step 1 into the equation from step 2:

5 x (x / 0.85) = $300

4. Simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 0.85 to eliminate the fraction:

5 x x = $300 x 0.85

5. Solve for x, the original price of each article, by dividing both sides by 5:

This means that there is a basic charge for the establishment's phone service, which remains the same every month, and an additional charge for each call made.

2. In one month, 540 calls were made, and the bill was Rs.1800.

We can assume that the basic charge for the month is Rs.1500 (since the bill is Rs.1800 and 540 calls were made, so the cost per call must be Rs.1500 / 540 = Rs.2.86).

3. In another month, 620 calls were made, and the bill was Rs.2040.

Using the same logic as before, we can assume that the basic charge for this month is also Rs.1500. Since there are more calls made in this month (620 vs. 540), the cost per call must be higher. Let's say the cost per call is Rs.2.94 (Rs.2040 / 620).

4. In another month, 500 units were consumed due to more holidays.

We don't know how many calls were made in this month, so we can't calculate the cost per call. However, we do know that there are fewer calls made in this month (500 units vs. 540 and 620), so the basic charge for this month must be higher to compensate for the lower number of calls.

Now let's analyze the options:

A) Rs.1560 - This is not correct, as the bill for the month with 540 calls was Rs.1800, which is higher than Rs.1560.

B) Rs.1680 - This is also not correct, as the bill for the month with 620 calls was Rs.2040, which is higher than Rs.1680.

C) Rs.1840 - This is the correct answer. We can calculate the cost per call for the month with 540 calls as Rs.2.86, and for the month with 620 calls as Rs.2.94. Since there are fewer calls made in the third month (500 units), the basic charge must be higher to compensate for the lower number of calls.","the bill for the third month would be Rs.1840 (Rs.1500 + (500 x Rs.2.94)).

D) Rs.1950 - This is not correct, as the bill for the month with 620 calls was Rs.2040, which is higher than Rs.1950.

E) Rs.1690 - This is also not correct, as the bill for the month with 540 calls was Rs.1800, which is higher than Rs.1690.

Therefore, the correct answer is C) Rs.1840.",B,False,long_chain,9

Here's the analysis of the problem:

1. Let's assume there are x water lilies on the lake initially (where x is any positive integer).
2. According to the problem statement, the number of water lilies doubles every two days. So, after 2 days, there will be 2x water lilies on the lake.
3. After another two days, the number of water lilies will double again, so there will be 4x water lilies on the lake.
4. Continuing this pattern, we can see that after 60 days (the time it takes for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies if there were only one water lily initially), there will be 2^60 = 1,125,897,713,648 water lilies on the lake.
5. Since we know that there were initially 64 water lilies on the lake, we can set up the equation:

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. First, we know that the train takes exact three seconds to enter the tunnel, which means it covers half the distance of the tunnel in 3 seconds.
2. Since the tunnel is 1 mile long, the total distance of the tunnel is 1 mile.
3. We can use the formula d = rt, where d is the distance traveled, r is the rate (in this case, the speed of the train), and t is the time taken to travel that distance.
4. Since the train is traveling at a speed of 120 miles per hour, we can calculate the distance it covers in one second as follows:

d = rt
= 120 mi/hr x 3 sec
= 360 ft/sec

5. Now, we know that the train covers half the distance of the tunnel in 3 seconds, so we can calculate the time taken to cover the entire tunnel as follows:

t = d / r

Here's the step-by-step analysis of the question:

1. Total amount borrowed = Rs.360
2. Number of installments = 12
3. Monthly installment amount = Rs.31.50

To find the interest rate, we can use the formula:

Interest rate = (Total amount x Rate) / (1 + Rate)^Number of installments

Where:

* Total amount is the principal amount borrowed (Rs.360 in this case)
* Rate is the interest rate as a decimal value (we need to find this out)
* Number of installments is the number of months over which the loan is repaid (12 in this case)

Now, let's try to solve for the interest rate using the given information:

We know that the monthly installment amount is Rs.31.50, so we can calculate the total amount paid over 12 months as follows:

Total amount paid = Monthly installment x Number of installments
= Rs.31.50 x 12
= Rs.378

Now, we can use the formula to find the interest rate:

Interest rate = (Total amount x Rate) / (1 + Rate)^Number of installments
= (Rs.360 x Rate) / (1 + Rate)^12

We know that the total amount borrowed is Rs.360, so we can substitute this value in:

Interest rate = (Rs.360 x Rate) / (1 + Rate)^12
= (Rs.360 x Rate) / 1.12^12

Now, we need to find the value of Rate. We can do this by rearranging the formula:

Rate = (Interest rate x 1.12)^(1/12)

We know that the interest rate is a decimal value, so we can multiply it by 1.12 to convert it to a fraction:

Rate = (0.12 x 1.12)^(1/12)
= (0.12 x 1.12)^1
= 0.12^1

We know that he takes 17 hours to go by train to the city and return by car, so we can set up the following equation:

x + 17 = 22 (since he takes 22 hours if he goes by train both ways)

Now, we know that if Mr. Sam goes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours, so we can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:

x + 17 - 4 = 22 - 4

Here's the step-by-step solution to the problem:

Step 1: Convert both speeds from miles per hour (mph) to hours per mile (hr/mile).

Car 1 speed = 12 mph = 0.067 hours/mile (since there are 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 / 12 = 0.067)

Car 2 speed = 13 mph = 0.075 hours/mile (using the same calculation as above)

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes for each car to cover the distance of the highway.

For Car 1:
Time = Distance / Speed
= 50 miles / 0.067 hours/mile
= 728 minutes (since there are 60 minutes in an hour, and 728 / 60 = 12)

For Car 2:
Time = Distance / Speed

Step 2: Identify the key quantities

Let's identify the key quantities in the problem:

* Amount of zinc (Z) in alloy X = 6/10 \* 40 = 24 grams
* Amount of copper (Cu) in alloy X = 9/10 \* 40 = 36 grams
* Amount of zinc (Z) in alloy Y = 7/11 \* 60 = 49 grams

If we have a ratio of w/25 gallons per x seconds, we can say that the ratio of gallons to seconds is 1:x or w:25.

3. Next, we need to identify the units of measurement for each quantity:

* Gallons (G)
* Seconds (s)

4. Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find out how many minutes it will take y gallons to pass through the drain:

We know that there are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so we can convert x seconds to minutes by dividing by 60:

x = (x/60) minutes

5. Now, let's use the ratio of w:25 to find out how many gallons will pass through the drain in one minute:

w/25 = (w/25)/60 = (w/25) x (1/60) = 25w/300

6. Now, we can set up an equation using the information we have:

y = (25w/300) x (1/60) = (25w/300) x (1/60) = 25wy/300

7. Finally, we can solve for the number of minutes it will take y gallons to pass through the drain:
