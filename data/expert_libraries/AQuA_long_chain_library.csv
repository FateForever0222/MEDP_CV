Let's dive into the problem and find the solution. The question states that the difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000, and the sum of the numbers is 1000. We can start by writing down these two equations: Equation 1: (x^2 + y^2) = 256000 ... (1) Equation 2: x + y = 1000 ... (2) Now, let's try to solve for x and y. We can start by using Equation 2 to eliminate one of the variables. Let's say we eliminate y: x + y = 1000 Subtracting x from both sides gives us: y = 1000 - x Now, let's substitute this expression for y in Equation 1: (x^2 + (1000 - x)^2) = 256000 Expanding the right-hand side gives us: (x^2 + 1000^2 - 2x(1000)) = 256000 Simplifying this expression, we get: x^2 + 1000^2 - 2x(1000) = 256000 Now, let's factor the left-hand side of the equation: (x + 500)(x - 480) = 0 This gives us two possible solutions for x: x = 480 or x = -500 Now that we have found the values of x and y, let's check if they satisfy Equation 2: x + y = 1000 For x = 480, we have: 480 + y = 1000 Solving for y, we get: y = 520 And for x = -500, we have: -500 + y = 1000 Solving for y, we get: y = -280 So, the two possible solutions for x and y are (480, 520) and (-500, -280).

Here's the analysis of the given question: Question: What is the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots? Let's start by analyzing the given equation: x2 - 5x + k = 0 We can factorize this equation as: (x - 3)(x - 2) + k = 0 Now, we need to find the largest integral value of 'k' for which the factors (x - 3) and (x - 2) have distinct real roots. Let's consider the factor (x - 3): (x - 3) = x - 3 The root of this factor is x = 3. Now, let's consider the factor (x - 2): (x - 2) = x - 2 The root of this factor is x = 2. Since we need two distinct real roots, we require that x = 3 and x = 2 be distinct. Therefore, we can set up the following inequality: 3 - 2 > k Simplifying this inequality, we get: 1 > k So, the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x2 - 5x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots is k = 1. Therefore, the correct answer is: B) 7 Note that we can also verify this answer by substituting k = 1 into the original equation and checking if it has two distinct real roots.

The sum of the digits of the number is x + y = 10x + y. 3. Since the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18, we can set up the equation: 10x + y + 18 = xy 4. Now, let's analyze the equation further. We know that x is double y, so we can write: x = 2y 5. Substituting this into the previous equation, we get: 10(2y) + y + 18 = 2y(y + 18) 6. Simplifying the left-hand side of the equation, we get: 20y + y + 18 = 2y(y + 18) 7. Comparison of the two expressions shows that they are equal if and only if y = 4. 8.

Here's the step-by-step analysis of the problem: Let's say the original price of an item is x. When the shopkeeper put a discount of 20%, he sold the items for 0.8x (i.e., 80% of the original price). Now, if he wants to sell the items at the original price again, he needs to increase the price by 20%. So, the new price will be: 1.2x = 1.2(original price) To find out what percentage increase this is, we can divide the increase in price by the original price: (1.2x - x) / x = (1.2 - 1) / 1 = 20% So, to increase the price back to the original price, the shopkeeper must increase it by 20%.

Here's the analysis of the question: Let X be the number of trousers purchased and Y be the number of shirts purchased. Given that the man spends Rs. 810 on buying trouser at Rs. 70 each and shirt at Rs. 30 each, we can write the equation: X \* 70 + Y \* 30 = 810 ... (1) Since the man has a maximum of 810 rupees to spend, we know that X + Y <= 810. Now, let's find the maximum value of X and Y that satisfy equation (1). To do this, we need to find the values of X and Y that make equation (1) true for all possible values of X and Y. First, let's solve equation (1) for X: X = 810 / 70 ... (2) X = 11 Now, let's solve equation (1) for Y: Y = 810 / 30 ...

Let's work through this problem together. Here's the information given in the question: 10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective. 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected. Let's start by identifying what we know and what we don't know. We know that: 10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective (i.e., 10% of the total number of staplers produced on Monday were defective). 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake (i.e., 2% of the total number of non-defective staplers were rejected). 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected. We don't know the total number of staplers produced on Monday. Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the total number of staplers produced on Monday. We know that 10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective, so if we subtract the number of defective staplers from the total number of staplers produced on Monday, we'll be left with the number of non-defective staplers. Let's use ""D"" to represent the total number of staplers produced on Monday: D = Total number of staplers produced on Monday We know that 10% of D were defective, so we can calculate the number of defective staplers as follows: Defective staplers = D x 0.10 We also know that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, so we can calculate the number of rejected non-defective staplers as follows: Rejected non-defective staplers = (D - Defective staplers) x 0.02 Now we have two equations and two unknowns (D and Non-defective staplers). We can use substitution or elimination to solve for D. Let's use substitution. We know that the number of defective staplers is 72, so we can substitute this value into one of the equations: Defective staplers = 72 Now we have: Non-defective staplers = (D - Defective staplers) x 0.02 Substituting D = 4,800 (option D): Non-defective staplers = (4,800 - 72) x 0.02 Simplifying: Non-defective staplers = 4,800 x 0.02 Now we have the total number of staplers produced on Monday: D = Non-defective staplers + Defective staplers Substituting D = 4,800: D = 4,800 + 72 Therefore, the total number of staplers produced on Monday was 4,872 (option C).",C,A,False,long_chain,24

Therefore, we can start by arranging the PM, MP, and MLA in any order. There are 3! = 6 possible ways to arrange the PM, MP, and MLA: 1. PM - MP - MLA 2. MP - PM - MLA 3. MLA - PM - MP 4. MLA - MP - PM 5. PM - MLA - MP 6. MP - MLA - PM Now, we need to arrange the remaining 7 speakers in any order. Since each speaker has to speak before the next one, there are 7! = 5040 possible ways to arrange them. However, not all of these arrangements satisfy the given protocol. We need to eliminate those that do not follow the protocol. For example, if the PM speaks before the MP, then we cannot have the MP speaking before the MLA. Similarly, if the MP speaks before the MLA, then we cannot have the PM speaking before the MLA. Therefore, we need to divide the total number of possible arrangements by the number of valid arrangements that satisfy the protocol. In this case, there are 3! = 6 valid arrangements: 1.

Let's start by analyzing the given information: * 8 men work for 6 days to complete a work. * We need to find out how many men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day. Now, let's think about the problem logically. If 8 men can complete the work in 6 days, then each man must be working for 6/8 = 3/4 day. So, if we need to complete the same work in 1/2 day, we will need more men who can work for the entire 1/2 day. Let's calculate the number of men required: * Total work done by 8 men in 6 days = 8 x 3/4 day = 6 x 3/4 day (since each man works for 3/4 day) * Total work done by 1 man in 1/2 day = 6 x 3/4 day / 2 = 9/4 day (since we need to complete the same work in 1/2 day) * Therefore, we need 9/4 men to complete the same work in 1/2 day.

First, let's calculate the amount of clay in the mixture: 30% of 10 kg = 3 kg (clay) Now, we need to remove 3 kg of clay from the mixture and replace it with pure sand. So, we need to add an equal amount of sand to the mixture. To find out how much sand we need to add, let's calculate the total weight of the mixture: 10 kg (mixture) = 3 kg (clay) + 7 kg (sand) Now, we want to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand, so we need to double the weight of the clay: 2 x 3 kg (clay) = 6 kg (clay) Now, we can calculate the amount of sand we need to add to the mixture: 6 kg (clay) + 7 kg (sand) = 13 kg So, we need to add 13 kg of sand to the mixture.
