AQuA,"A club consists of members whose ages are in A.P. The common difference being 3 months. If the youngest member of the club is just 7 years old and the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, then number of members in the club are :","{'A': 'A)18', 'B': 'B)20', 'C': 'C)25', 'D': 'D)26', 'E': 'E)27'}",Let's analyze this in detail step by step.,"Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's the step-by-step analysis of the question: 1. The youngest member of the club is just 7 years old. So, we know that the ages of all members must be in A.P., and the common difference must be 3 months. 2. The sum of the ages of all the members is 250. Let's say there are x members in the club, where x is a positive integer. Since the youngest member is 7 years old, the next member will be 7 + 3 = 10 years old, and so on. So, the ages of all members can be represented as: 7, 10, 13, ..., x - 3 where x is the number of members in the club. Now, let's find out the sum of these ages: 7 + 10 + 13 + ... + (x - 3) = 250 Since the common difference is 3 months, we can write: 7 + 10 + 13 + ... + (x - 3) = 250 We can simplify this equation by noticing that each term is 3 months apart: 7 + 10 + 13 + ... + (x - 3) = 250 7 + 10 + 13 + ... + x = 250 Now, we can see that the left-hand side of the equation is an A.P. with a common difference of 3 months, and the right-hand side is equal to 250. So, we can set up the equation: 7 + 10 + 13 + ... + x = 250 We know that the sum of an A.P. is given by the formula: n/2(a + l) where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the common difference. In this case, n = x, a = 7, and l = 3. So, we can substitute these values into the equation: n/2(a + l) = 250 x/2(7 + 3) = 250 x/2(10) = 250 x = 250 x 2 = 500 Therefore, there are 500 members in the club. Now, let's check the options: Option A: 18 No, that's not correct. The sum of the ages of all members is 250, and the youngest member is 7 years old, so none of the members can be 18 years old. Option B: 20 No, that's not correct either. The sum of the ages of all members is 250, and the youngest member is 7 years old, so none of the members can be 20 years old. Option C: 25 No, that's not correct either. The sum of the ages of all members is 250, and the youngest member is 7 years old, so none of the members can be 25 years old. Option D: 26 No, that's not correct either. The sum of the ages of all members is 250, and the youngest member is 7 years old, so none of the members can be 26 years old. Option E: 27 No, that's not correct either. The sum of the ages of all members is 250, and the youngest member is 7 years old, so none of the members can be 27 years old. Therefore, the correct answer is option B: 20. But wait, we just proved that none of the options are correct! So, the answer must be ""None of the above"".",A,C,False,long_chain,2
AQuA,"A shopkeeper employed a servant at a monthly salary of 1500. In addition to it, he agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000?","{'A': 'A)30000', 'B': 'B)415000', 'C': 'C)31500', 'D': 'D)50000', 'E': 'E)None of these'}",Let's analyze this in detail step by step.,"Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's the step-by-step analysis of the question: 1. The shopkeeper employed a servant at a monthly salary of 1500. So, the servant's monthly salary is 1500 rupees. 2. In addition to it, he agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. So, if the servant sells any goods during the month, he will receive a commission of 15% on those sales, in addition to his monthly salary. 3. How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000? To find out how much the servant needs to sell in order to earn a monthly income of 6000 rupees, we need to use the information given in the question. Let's break down the information: * The servant's monthly salary is 1500 rupees. * He receives a commission of 15% on any sales he makes during the month. * He wants his monthly income to be 6000 rupees. So, we can set up an equation based on these facts: 1500 + (15% of x) = 6000 Where x is the amount of sales the servant makes during the month. To solve for x, we can first calculate the commission as a percentage of the sales: 15% of x = 15% x Now we can substitute the values we know into the equation: 1500 + (15% x) = 6000 Subtracting 1500 from both sides gives us: (15% x) = 4500 Dividing both sides by 15% gives us: x = 4500 / 15% x = 30000 So, the servant needs to sell goods worth 30000 rupees during the month to earn a monthly income of 6000 rupees. Now let's analyze the options given in the question: A) 30000 This is the correct answer, as we have already calculated that the servant needs to sell goods worth 30000 rupees to earn a monthly income of 6000 rupees. B) 415000 This option is incorrect because it is not possible for the servant to sell goods worth 415000 rupees in one month, as that amount is much higher than the total sales of any reasonable business. C) 31500 This option is also incorrect because it is not possible for the servant to sell goods worth 31500 rupees in one month, as that amount is much lower than the total sales of any reasonable business. D) 50000 This option is incorrect for the same reason as option C - it is not possible for the servant to sell goods worth 50000 rupees in one month. E) None of these This option is incorrect because we have already calculated that the servant needs to sell goods worth 30000 rupees to earn a monthly income of 6000 rupees. Therefore, the correct answer is A) 30000.",A,A,True,long_chain,3
AQuA,"Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar?","{'A': 'A)4', 'B': 'B)5', 'C': 'C)6', 'D': 'D)7', 'E': 'E)8'}",Let's analyze this in detail step by step.,"Sure, I can help you with that! Here's the step-by-step analysis of the problem: 1. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. This means that P's rate of eating is 1 candy per minute. 2. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. This means that Q's rate of eating is 2 candies per minute (since there are twice as many candies in the jar as there are in half the jar). 3. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, we need to find out how long it would take them to eat the entire jar together. Let's call this time 't'. 4. We know that P can eat 1 candy per minute, so P can eat t candies in t minutes. 5. We also know that Q can eat 2 candies per minute, so Q can eat 2t candies in t minutes. 6. Since there are a total of t + 2t = 3t candies in the jar, we can set up the equation: t + 2t = 3t Simplifying this equation, we get: 3t = 3t Solving for t, we get: t = 1 So it would take them both together 1 minute to eat the entire jar of candies. Therefore, the correct answer is option A: 4 minutes.",A,B,False,long_chain,3
