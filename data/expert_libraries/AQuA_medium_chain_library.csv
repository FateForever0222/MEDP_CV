Here's how we can approach it:

Let X be the number of yellow golf balls the store had to begin the day.

We know that the store sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls, so the number of golf balls sold is 0.8 \* 600 = 480.

Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, the number of white golf balls sold is equal to the number of yellow golf balls sold: 480.

We also know that the store had only yellow and white golf balls, so the total number of golf balls sold must be equal to the number of yellow golf balls sold plus the number of white golf balls sold: 480 = X + 480.

Solving for X, we get:

X = 480 - 480 = 0

Here's the solution step by step:

1. First, we know that Alice wants to fence three sides of her rectangular yard, so she needs to find the perimeter of the yard. To do this, we need to add up the lengths of all four sides.
2. The yard is rectangular, so all four sides are equal in length. Let's call this length x (since we don't know what it is yet).
3. Since Alice wants to leave one side unfenced, she needs to find the length of that side. We know that the total perimeter of the yard is 240 meters, so we can set up an equation:

x + x + x = 240 (since there are three sides to fence)

Simplifying this equation:

3x = 240

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = 80

So, the length of each side of Alice's yard is 80 meters.

a > x > b > 0 > y
3. Next, we can find the height of the triangle by subtracting the smallest side (b) from the largest side (a):

height = a - b
4. Now, we can find the base of the triangle by subtracting the smallest side (b) from the middle side (x):

base = x - b
5. Finally, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle to find the area:

The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days.
If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies.
2. Now, let's think about the initial number of water lilies:

There are initially 64 water lilies on the lake.

AQuA,"A man borrows Rs.360 If he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50, what is his interest rate?","{'A': 'A)1.5%', 'B': 'B)4.5%', 'C': 'C)10%', 'D': 'D)5%', 'E': 'E)12%'}",Let's think step by step.,"Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's the solution step by step:

1. Total amount borrowed = Rs.360
2. Number of installments = 12
3. Monthly installment amount = Rs.31.50

To find the interest rate, we can use the formula:

Interest rate = (Total amount x Rate) / Number of installments

Where:

* Total amount is the principal amount borrowed (Rs.360 in this case)
* Rate is the interest rate as a decimal (we'll calculate this later)
* Number of installments is the number of months over which the loan is repaid (12 in this case)

Now, let's calculate the interest rate. We know that the monthly installment amount is Rs.31.50, so we can use this to find the total interest paid over the 12-month period:

Total interest = Monthly installment x Number of installments
Total interest = Rs.31.50 x 12
Total interest = Rs.378

Now, we can use the formula again to find the interest rate:

Interest rate = (Total amount x Rate) / Number of installments
Interest rate = (Rs.360 x Rate) / 12

We know that the total amount borrowed is Rs.360, so we can substitute this into the formula:

Interest rate = (Rs.360 x Rate) / 12
Interest rate = (Rs.360 x Rate) / 12

To find the interest rate, we need to divide the total interest paid (Rs.378) by the total amount borrowed (Rs.360):

Interest rate = Total interest / Total amount
Interest rate = Rs.378 / Rs.360
Interest rate = 12%

So, the interest rate is 12%.",the correct answer is option E: 12%.,D,False,medium_chain,5

What is the distance between A and B?","{'A': 'A)180', 'B': 'B)90', 'C': 'C)270', 'D': 'D)360', 'E': 'E)None of the above'}",Let's think step by step.,"Sure, I'd be happy to help you solve this problem! Here's how we can approach it:

1. Let's first calculate the time it takes Kevin to drive from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph:

Time = Distance / Speed

We know that the distance between A and B is x miles, so we can plug in the values as follows:

Time = x / 70

2. Now, we know that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, Kevin was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. This means that he started returning to A 3 hours before the end of his trip, so we can set up an equation based on this information:

Time = 3 hours before the end of the trip

We know that the trip takes 3 hours, so we can calculate the time as follows:

Time = 3 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

3. Now, we have two equations: one for the time it takes Kevin to drive from A to B, and another for the time he spent returning to A:

Equation 1: Time = x / 70 (for driving from A to B)

Equation 2: Time = 180 minutes (for returning to A)

4. We can now solve these equations simultaneously to find the value of x, which represents the distance between A and B:

Solving Equation 1 for x, we get:

x = 70 miles x Time = 70 miles x (x / 70)

Simplifying, we get:

x = 70 miles x (x / 70)

x = 70 miles x (x / 70)

Now, let's substitute the value of Time from Equation 2 into Equation 1:

x = 70 miles x (180 minutes / 70)

Simplifying, we get:

x = 70 miles x 2.5

x = 175 miles","the distance between A and B is 175 miles.

Here's the solution step by step:

1. Let's first find out the distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow. We know that Train A leaves Mumbai Central at 11 am and runs at a speed of 40 kmph, so it will cover:

Distance = Speed x Time = 40 kmph x 5 hours (since it leaves at 11 am and takes 5 hours to reach Lucknow) = 200 km

2. Now, we know that Train B leaves Mumbai Central at 2 pm and runs at a speed of 72 kmph. It will cover the same distance as Train A in less time, since it is running faster:

Distance = Speed x Time = 72 kmph x 3 hours (since it leaves at 2 pm and takes 3 hours to reach Lucknow) = 216 km

3. Since both trains are covering the same distance, we can set up an equation based on the distances they cover:

200 km = 40 kmph x 5 hours
216 km = 72 kmph x 3 hours

4. Now, we can solve for the time it takes for Train B to reach Lucknow:

Time for Train B = Distance / Speed = 216 km / 72 kmph = 3 hours

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Total number of pens produced = 7200 (given)
2. Defective pens = 10% of total production = 10% x 7200 = 720 (calculated)
3. Total number of good pens = Total production - Defective pens = 7200 - 720 = 6480 (calculated)
4. Profit on total production = 25% x 7200 = 1800 (given)
5. Profit on good pens = Profit on total production / Total number of good pens = 1800 / 6480 = 2.83 (calculated)

Here's how we can approach this problem step by step:

Step 1: Understand the given information

We know that alloys X and Y are made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratios 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. We also know that 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z.

Step 2: Identify the key information we need to find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z

To find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z, we need to know the total weight of the mixture (i.e., the sum of the weights of zinc and copper) and the individual weights of zinc and copper in each alloy.

Let's start by identifying the key information we need:

* Total weight of the mixture = 40 grams + 60 grams = 100 grams
* Weight of zinc in alloy X = 6/9 x 40 grams = 24 grams
* Weight of copper in alloy X = 9/9 x 40 grams = 56 grams
* Weight of zinc in alloy Y = 7/11 x 60 grams = 34 grams
* Weight of copper in alloy Y = 11/11 x 60 grams = 66 grams

Step 3: Calculate the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z

Now that we have all the information we need, let's calculate the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z:

* Total weight of zinc in alloy Z = 24 grams + 34 grams = 58 grams
* Total weight of copper in alloy Z = 56 grams + 66 grams = 122 grams

To find the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z, we can divide the total weight of zinc by the total weight of copper:

Ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z = 58/122 = 0.47

So, the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z is approximately 0.47 or 47%.

Now, let's check the options:

Option A: 69:91
Option B: 59:91
Option C: 59:90
Option D: 59:91
Option E: 69:101

None of these options match the correct ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z, which is approximately 0.47 or 47%.","none of these options are the correct answer.

1. First, we need to convert the rate of liquid passing through the drain from gallons per second to gallons per minute. There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so:

w/25 gallons/second = w/25 x 60 = 1500 w gallons/minute

2. Next, we need to convert the volume of liquid (y gallons) to be passed through the drain from gallons to minutes. We know that there are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so:

y gallons x 60 = 60y minutes

3. Now we can set up a proportion to find out how many minutes it will take for y gallons of liquid to pass through the drain:

1500w gallons/minute = 60y minutes

4. To solve for y, we can cross-multiply and simplify:
