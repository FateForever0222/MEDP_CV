AQuA,"A shopkeeper employed a servant at a monthly salary of 1500. In addition to it, he agreed to pay him a commission of 15% on the monthly sale. How much sale in Rupees should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000?","{'A': 'A)30000', 'B': 'B)415000', 'C': 'C)31500', 'D': 'D)50000', 'E': 'E)None of these'}",Let's think step by step.,"Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's the step-by-step solution: 1. First, we know that the servant's monthly salary is Rs. 1500. 2. Additionally, we know that the servant receives a commission of 15% on the monthly sales. 3. To find out the total monthly sale, we can use the formula: Total Sales = Monthly Salary x (1 + Commission Percentage) 4. In this case, the commission percentage is 15%, so we can calculate the total monthly sale as follows: Total Sales = Rs. 1500 x (1 + 15%) = Rs. 1500 x 1.15 = Rs. 1725 5. Now, we know that the servant's total monthly income is his salary plus his commission: Total Income = Monthly Salary + Commission = Rs. 1500 + Rs. 1725 = Rs. 3225 6. Finally, we can find out the sale that the servant needs to do to earn a monthly income of Rs. 6000 by dividing his desired monthly income by his total monthly income: Sale Required = Desired Monthly Income / Total Monthly Income = Rs. 6000 / Rs. 3225 = 1.875 So, the servant needs to do a sale of approximately Rs. 1875 to earn a monthly income of Rs. 6000. The correct answer is option C: Rs. 31500.",C,A,False,medium_chain,4
