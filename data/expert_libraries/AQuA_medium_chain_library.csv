AQuA,"If n is such that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, then x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4) satisfies","{'A': 'A)20 < x < 54', 'B': 'B)23 < x < 58', 'C': 'C)25 < x < 64', 'D': 'D)28 < x < 60', 'E': 'E)None of these'}",Let's think step by step.,"Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's the solution step by step: 1. First, let's analyze the expression x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4): We can see that the numerator is a quadratic expression in n, and the denominator is a linear expression in n. Therefore, this expression is a rational function of n. 2. Now, let's consider the given range of values for n: 36 ≤ n ≤ 72. We can see that the minimum value of n is 36, and the maximum value of n is 72. Therefore, we need to find the minimum and maximum values of x for this range of n. 3. To find the minimum value of x, we need to find the minimum value of n, which is 36. Substituting n = 36 into the expression x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4), we get: x = (362 + 2√36(36 + 4) + 16) / (36 + 4√36 + 4) Simplifying, we get: x = (144 + 2(36)(4) + 16) / (36 + 4(36) + 4) x = (144 + 576 + 16) / (36 + 144 + 4) x = 720 / 180 x = 4 Therefore, the minimum value of x is 4. 4. To find the maximum value of x, we need to find the maximum value of n, which is 72. Substituting n = 72 into the expression x = (n2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n+ 4√n+ 4), we get: x = (722 + 2√72(72 + 4) + 16) / (72 + 4√72 + 4) Simplifying, we get: x = (504 + 2(72)(4) + 16) / (72 + 4(72) + 4) x = (504 + 3072 + 16) / (72 + 288 + 4) x = 3600 / 320 x = 11 Therefore, the maximum value of x is 11. 5. Now, we need to choose the correct option from the given choices. Since the minimum value of x is 4 and the maximum value of x is 11, we can see that option A (20 < x < 54) does not include the minimum value of x, so it is not the correct choice. Option B (23 < x < 58) includes the minimum value of x, but not the maximum value of x. Therefore, option B is the correct choice. So, the answer is: B) 23 < x < 58",B,D,False,medium_chain,5

AQuA,"Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need?","{'A': 'A)58', 'B': 'B)62', 'C': 'C)66', 'D': 'D)70', 'E': 'E)74'}",Let's think step by step.,"Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's the solution step by step: 1. First, we know that Alice wants to fence three sides of her rectangular yard, so she needs to find the perimeter of the yard. To do this, we need to add up the lengths of all four sides. 2. The yard is rectangular, so all four sides are equal in length. Let's call this length x (since we don't know what it is yet). 3. Since Alice wants to leave one side unfenced, we know that one side will be 10 meters long (since she wants to leave 10 meters unfenced). 4. Now we can set up an equation based on the information we have: Perimeter = 2(length of each side) + length of the unfenced side In this case, the perimeter would be: Perimeter = 2x + 10 5. Since the yard has an area of 240 square meters, we know that the total length of all four sides must be equal to the perimeter of the yard. So we can substitute the equation we set up earlier into this one: 240 = 2(x) + 10 6. Simplifying and solving for x, we get: 240 = 2x + 10 2x = 240 - 10 2x = 230 x = 115 7. Now that we know the length of each side is 115 meters, we can calculate the amount of fencing Alice needs: Fencing needed = 3 x 115 + 10 Fencing needed = 345 + 10 Fencing needed = 355 meters So the correct answer is option C: 66 meters.",C,A,False,medium_chain,5

Here's a step-by-step guide: 1. Let the two-digit number be xy, where x is the digit in the unit's place and y is the digit in the ten's place. 2. The sum of the digits of the number is x + y = 10 + 10 = 20. 3. The number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18, so we can set up the equation: xy + 18 = 20 4. Since the digit in the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place, we know that x = 2y. 5. Substituting this into the equation from step 3, we get: 2y + 18 = 20 6. Simplifying, we get: 4y + 18 = 40 7. Now, we can see that y = 12, so x = 2y = 24. 8. Therefore, the two-digit number is 24. So, the correct answer is option B: 24.",B,B,True,medium_chain,5

Here's the solution step by step: 1. The triangle has vertices at (a,0), (b,0), and (x,y). 2. We know that a > x > b > 0 > y, so we can start by writing down the inequalities: a > x > b > 0 > y 3. Next, we can find the height of the triangle by subtracting the smallest side (b) from the largest side (a): height = a - b 4. Now, we can find the base of the triangle by subtracting the smallest side (b) from the middle side (x): base = x - b 5. Finally, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle to find the area: area = (base × height) / 2 So, substituting the values we have found: area = [(x - b) × (a - b)] / 2 6. Simplifying and solving for the area: area = (x^2 - ab) / 2 Now, we can compare this with the options given: Option A: A)(ay−by)/2 We can see that option A is not equal to the area of the triangle, so it cannot be the correct answer. Option B: B)(ab−ay)/2 We can see that option B is equal to the area of the triangle, so it must be the correct answer. Therefore, the correct answer is: B) (ab - ay) / 2",B,C,False,medium_chain,5

Here's how we can solve this problem step by step: 1. Let's say there are n balls in the box, and each ball is marked with a number from 1 to n. 2. We know that there are 45 different ways to select two balls from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected. 3. Since we want to avoid selecting the ball with number 3, we can only choose one of the other n-1 balls for the first selection. 4. For the second selection, we have to choose a ball that is different from the first ball and also different from the ball with number 3. This means we have (n-2) choices for the second selection. 5. Therefore, the total number of ways to select two balls from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected is: (n-1) x (n-2) = n^2 - 3n + 2 6. Since there are 45 different ways to select two balls, we can set up the equation: n^2 - 3n + 2 = 45 7. Solving for n, we get: n = 8 So, the value of n is 8.

If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. 2. Now, let's think about the initial number of water lilies: There are initially 64 water lilies on the lake. 3. Since the number of water lilies doubles every two days, we can calculate the number of water lilies after each doubling period: Day 1: 64 water lilies (initial) Day 2: 128 water lilies (doubled from 64) Day 4: 256 water lilies (doubled from 128) Day 6: 512 water lilies (doubled from 256) Day 8: 1024 water lilies (doubled from 512) 4. Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies, given the initial number of water lilies is 64. We know that if there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. So, we can set up a proportion: Proportion: 64 water lilies / 60 days = 1 water lily / x days where x is the number of days it will take for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies, given the initial number of water lilies is 64. 5. Now, we can solve for x: Cross-multiplying and simplifying, we get: x = 30 Therefore, it will take 30 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies, given that there are initially 64 water lilies on the lake.
