Here's the solution to the problem:

Fernando has a university meal plan that allows him to have a total of 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. Since the cafeteria is closed on weekends, he has only 5 days to allocate his meals (Monday to Friday).

He always goes home for dinner on Friday nights, so he can't use any of his dinner allowances on Fridays. Therefore, he has 5 lunches and 3 dinners to allocate among the 5 days of the week.

Let's denote the number of lunches and dinners allocated to each day as follows:

Lunches: Monday (L1), Tuesday (L2), Wednesday (L3), Thursday (L4), Friday (no lunch)
Dinners: Monday (D1), Tuesday (D2), Wednesday (D3), Thursday (D4), Friday (no dinner)

Since Fernando has 5 lunches and 3 dinners to allocate, we can represent this using a combination of 5C3 (5 choices for each of 3 lunches) and 4C2 (4 choices for each of 2 dinners):

A) 5C3*4C2 = 10*16 = 160 options

Let's work through this problem together.

Fernando has a university meal plan that allows him to have a total of 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. Since the cafeteria is closed on weekends, Fernando has 5 days to allocate his meals (Monday to Friday).

Let's start by identifying the number of lunches and dinners Fernando can have each day:

* Monday: 1 lunch, 1 dinner
* Tuesday: 1 lunch, 1 dinner
* Wednesday: 1 lunch, 1 dinner
* Thursday: 1 lunch, 1 dinner
* Friday: 1 lunch, no dinner (he goes home for dinner on Fridays)

Now, let's count the total number of lunches and dinners Fernando can have each week:

Lunches: 5 x 1 = 5
Dinners: 5 x 1 = 5

Total meals per week: 5 + 5 = 10

So, Fernando has 10 options to allocate his meals. The correct answer is E) 4C3*4C3, as he can choose 4 lunches and 4 dinners each week.",E,False,4.335300445556641,833,831

Here's the analysis of the question:

1. Fernando has a university meal plan that allows him to have a total of 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week.
2. The cafeteria is closed on weekends.
3. Fernando always goes home for dinner on Friday nights.

Now, let's think about how many options Fernando has to allocate his meals:

Option A: 5C3*4C3 = 5 x 4 x 3 = 60 meals

Option B: 5C4*4C2 = 5 x 4 x 2 = 40 meals

Option C: 5C2*4C4 = 5 x 2 x 4 = 40 meals

Option D: 5C6*4C5 = 5 x 6 x 4 = 120 meals

Option E: 4C3*4C3 = 4 x 3 x 4 = 48 meals

So, we can see that Option A has the most number of meals (60), while Option E has the least number of meals (48).

So, we know that the electric pole is 14 meters high and casts a shadow of 10 meters. This means that for every meter of height, the pole casts a shadow of 10/14 = 0.71 meters.

Now, we're given that the tree casts a shadow of 15 meters. So, if we want to find the height of the tree, we can use the same ratio as before:

I'd be happy to help you with that. Here's the solution step by step:

Let's say the height of the tree is x meters.

We know that the electric pole casts a shadow of 10 meters, so the height of the electric pole is 14 - 10 = 4 meters.

Now, we know that the tree casts a shadow of 15 meters. So, we can set up an equation:

x + 4 = 15 ... (1)

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 4 = 15 ... (2)

Subtracting 4 from both sides:

2x = 11 ... (3)

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 5.5 ... (4)

Here's the step-by-step analysis of the question:

1. The electric pole is 14 meters high, and it casts a shadow of 10 meters. This means that the height of the shadow is equal to the height of the pole minus the height of the object casting the shadow (in this case, the electric pole). So, we can set up an equation based on this information:

Shadow height = Pole height - Object height

2. We know that the object height (the tree) is what we're trying to find, so we can substitute ""Object height"" for ""Tree height"" in the equation:

Tree height = Pole height - Shadow height

3. We also know that the shadow height is 10 meters, so we can substitute ""10"" for ""Shadow height"" in the equation:

Tree height = Pole height - 10

4. Now we need to find the pole height. The question tells us that the electric pole is 14 meters high, so we can substitute ""14"" for ""Pole height"" in the equation:

Tree height = 14 - 10

5. Simplifying the equation, we get:

Tree height = 4

So, the tree that casts a shadow of 15 meters under similar conditions is 4 meters high.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A) 21

1. Let's first analyze the given information:
We know that if we walk 20 steps and stop, we reach the bottom in 10 minutes. This means that the elevator moves at a speed of 20 steps per minute (since there are 20 steps in 10 minutes).

2. Now, let's analyze the second part of the information:
If we walk 10 steps and stop, we reach the bottom in 20 minutes. This means that the elevator moves at a speed of 10 steps per minute (since there are 10 steps in 20 minutes).

3. Now, let's think about the speed of the elevator:
We know that the elevator moves at a speed of 20 steps per minute when we walk 20 steps and stop, and it moves at a speed of 10 steps per minute when we walk 10 steps and stop. So, the speed of the elevator must be between 10 and 20 steps per minute.

4. Now, let's choose an option:

Let's dive into the problem and find the speed of the elevator.

So, we know that if we walk 20 steps and stop, we reach the bottom in 10 minutes. This means that the distance traveled per minute is:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = Speed x 10 minutes

Since we know that we walk 20 steps in 10 minutes, we can calculate the speed as follows:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 20 steps / 10 minutes

Now, we can see that the speed of the elevator is:

Speed = 2 steps/minute (option B)

Therefore, the correct answer is option B: 2 steps/minute.

Let's now analyze the second part of the problem. If we walk 10 steps and stop, we reach the bottom in 20 minutes. This means that the distance traveled per minute is:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = Speed x 20 minutes

Since we know that we walk 10 steps in 20 minutes, we can calculate the speed as follows:
