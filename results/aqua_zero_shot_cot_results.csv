"Boomtown urban planners expect the city’s population to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. If that projection were to come true, the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago. Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year?","{'A': 'A)20%', 'B': 'B)40%', 'C': 'C)50%', 'D': 'D)65%', 'E': 'E)75%'}",D," Sure, let's work through this problem step by step!

So, we know that the population of Boomtown is expected to increase by 10% per year over the next two years. That means that if the population one year ago was P, then the population today is P + 10% of P, and the population two years from now will be P + 20% of P.

We're also given that the population two years from now is expected to be exactly double the population of one year ago. So we can set up an equation based on that:

P + 20% of P = 2P

Now, we need to find out what percentage increase this represents. To do that, we can divide both sides of the equation by P:

(P + 20% of P) / P = 2

Simplifying, we get:

1 + 20% = 2

1 + 20% = 2P

Now, we can see that 20% is equal to 2/P, so the percentage increase in Boomtown's population over the last year is:

20% = 2/P

The closest answer choice to this percentage increase is:

C) 50%

"A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm). If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum?","{'A': 'A)36 grams', 'B': 'B)40 grams', 'C': 'C)42 grams', 'D': 'D)48 grams', 'E': 'E)50 grams'}",B," Sure, let's work through this problem step by step!

Given:

* The coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm).
* The weight of the coin is 30 grams.
* The volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver.

We know that the weight of the coin is 30 grams, so we can start by finding the volume of the coin:

Volume = π x (2 x 15 mm)² x 2 mm = 3.48 cm³

Since the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver, we know that the volume of silver in the coin is also 3.48 cm³.

We can find the weight of one unit volume of aluminum by using its density:

Density of aluminum = 2.7 g/cm³

Weight of one unit volume of aluminum = density x volume = 2.7 g/cm³ x 3.48 cm³ = 9.1 grams

Now, we know that the weight of the coin is 30 grams, so we can set up an equation to represent this information:

Weight of aluminum in the coin = Weight of coin - Weight of silver in the coin

Substituting the values we have found, we get:

Weight of aluminum in the coin = 30 grams - (2 x 3.48 cm³ x density of silver)

Since the volume of silver in the coin is twice that of aluminum, we can substitute 2 times the weight of one unit volume of aluminum:

Weight of aluminum in the coin = 30 grams - (2 x 3.48 cm³ x 2.7 g/cm³)

Simplifying and solving for the weight of the aluminum, we get:

Weight of aluminum in the coin = 30 grams - (2 x 3.48 cm³ x 2.7 g/cm³)
= 30 grams - 14.96 grams
= 15.04 grams

Therefore, the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum would be:

A can construct a wall in 40 min and B can construct the wall in 45 min. How many hours is needed to contruct a wall if both the person working together.,"{'A': 'A)20 min', 'B': 'B)22 min', 'C': 'C)23 min', 'D': 'D)21 min', 'E': 'E)20 min'}",D," Sure, let's break down the problem step by step!

Let's say A and B work together to construct a wall.

A can construct a wall in 40 minutes, so if A works alone, it will take:

40 minutes = 0.4 hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)

B can construct a wall in 45 minutes, so if B works alone, it will take:

45 minutes = 0.45 hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)

Now, let's think about how long it would take for both A and B to work together to construct the wall.

Since they are working together, their combined time will be the sum of their individual times:

0.4 + 0.45 = 0.85 hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour)

Therefore, it would take both A and B working together approximately 0.85 hours (or 51 minutes) to construct a wall.

Let's say ant A starts moving at 9 cm per hour, so it will cover 9 cm in one hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, ant A will cover 9 x 60 = 540 cm in 60 minutes.

Now, let's find out how far ant B will travel in the same time period. Ant B is moving at a speed of 6 cm per hour, so it will cover 6 x 60 = 360 cm in 60 minutes.

Since the farms are 75 cm away from each other, we know that ant A will travel 75 cm before meeting ant B. Therefore, the correct answer is:

C) 51 cm

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Ant A moves at a speed of 9 cm per hour.
2. In one hour, ant A covers 9 x 60 = 540 cm.

A sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. How many sales of $250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000?,"{'A': 'A)15', 'B': 'B)24', 'C': 'C)25', 'D': 'D)40', 'E': 'E)52'}",D," Sure, let's work through this problem step by step!

The sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale they make, so if they make $250 in sales, they will earn $25 (10% of $250).

To reach a salary of at least $1000, the sales person must earn at least $1000 - $250 = $750 in commissions.

So, we can set up an equation:

$750 = 10% x (?)

where ? is the amount of sales the sales person must make to earn $750 in commissions.

We know that 10% of $250 is $25, so we can start by trying to find out how many times the sales person must sell $250 worth of products to reach $750 in commissions:

$750 / $25 = ?

Simplifying, we get:

? = 750 / 25 = 30

So, the sales person must make 30 sales of $250 each to reach a salary of at least $1000.

The original retail price of the appliance was 60% more than its wholesale cost, so we can set up an equation based on that:

Retail price = Wholesale cost x 1.6

Now, we know that the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, so we can set up another equation based on that:

Sold price = Retail price x 0.8

We can substitute the first equation into the second one to get:

Sold price = Wholesale cost x 1.6 x 0.8

Simplifying, we get:

Sold price = Wholesale cost x 1.32

Now, we need to find out what percent more than the wholesale cost the sold price is. To do this, we can divide the sold price by the wholesale cost and multiply by 100:

(Sold price / Wholesale cost) x 100

Substituting the values we have, we get:

((Wholesale cost x 1.32) / Wholesale cost) x 100

So, we know that the bee can sense when a flower does not have any nectar in it, and it bypasses those flowers. We also know that the bee flies by 2000 flowers in total.

Let's say the bee bypasses x flowers that do not have any nectar. We can set up an equation based on the information given:

x / 2000 = 0.05%

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 100 to get rid of the percentage:

x = 2000 x 0.05

x = 100

So, the bee bypasses 100 flowers that do not have any nectar.

Now, we need to find out how many flowers the bee will fly by in total. We know that it flies by 2000 flowers in total, and it bypasses 100 of them:

Total flowers = 2000 - 100

Total flowers = 1900

III. Q is the product of two prime numbers.","{'A': 'A)I only', 'B': 'B)III only', 'C': 'C)II only', 'D': 'D)I and II only', 'E': 'E)I and III only'}",B," Sure, let's go through the question step by step!

If Q, a positive integer, has 5 factors, we know that:

1. Q must be divisible by 1 and itself (since it has 5 factors).
2. Q must be divisible by 2 (since it has 5 factors).
3. Q must be divisible by 3 (since it has 5 factors).
4. Q must be divisible by 4 (since it has 5 factors).
5. Q must be divisible by 5 (since it has 5 factors).

Now, let's analyze each option:

A) Q is the square of a prime number.

If Q were the square of a prime number, it would have only two factors: 1 and itself. However, since Q has 5 factors, this option is not possible. So, we can eliminate option A.

B) Q is the fourth power of a prime number.

If Q were the fourth power of a prime number, it would have four factors: 1, 2, 3, and itself. However, since Q has 5 factors, this option is also not possible. So, we can eliminate option B.

C) Q is the product of two prime numbers.

If Q were the product of two prime numbers, it would have four factors: 1, 2, 3, and itself. This is possible, but it's not necessarily true that Q has only five factors. So, we can't eliminate option C yet.

D) Q is the square of a prime number and the product of two prime numbers.

This option is not possible since Q cannot be both the square of a prime number and the product of two prime numbers at the same time. So, we can eliminate option D.

E) Q is the product of two prime numbers and 3.

If Q were the product of two prime numbers and 3, it would have five factors: 1, 2, 3, and the two prime numbers. This is the only option that is still possible, so we can select option E as the correct answer.

There are 5 horses in the race, and Mr. Jain selects two of them at random. Let's say he selects horse A and horse B.

To find the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse, we need to consider all possible combinations of horses that could win the race. There are a total of 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120 possible combinations.

Now, let's count the number of combinations in which Mr. Jain selects the winning horse:

1. If he selects horse A and horse B, there are 4 other horses that could win the race (horse C, horse D, horse E, and no horse). So, there are 4 possible combinations in which Mr. Jain selects the winning horse.
2. If he selects horse A and horse C, there are 3 other horses that could win the race (horse B, horse D, and horse E). So, there are 3 possible combinations in which Mr. Jain selects the winning horse.
3. If he selects horse A and horse D, there are 2 other horses that could win the race (horse B and horse E). So, there are 2 possible combinations in which Mr. Jain selects the winning horse.
4. If he selects horse A and horse E, there is only one other horse that could win the race (horse B). So, there is only one possible combination in which Mr. Jain selects the winning horse.

In total, there are 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 possible combinations in which Mr. Jain selects the winning horse.

Now, let's calculate the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse:

Probability = Number of combinations in which Mr. Jain selects the winning horse / Total number of combinations

Let's say the number of copper coins she brought is x.

We know that the total amount she earned from all the coins is $3.40.

From the copper coins, she earned 20 cents per coin, so the contribution of the copper coins to the total amount is:

20 cents x number of copper coins = 20x

We also know that the total amount she earned from all the brass coins is:

25 cents x number of brass coins

Since there are no brass coins, this contribution is zero.

So, the total amount she earned is:

20x + 0 = 3.40

x = 3

Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins she brought is 3.

Given:

* R, S, T, and U are points on a line.
* U is the midpoint of line segment ST.
* The lengths of line segments RS, RT, and ST are 5, 17, and 22, respectively.

Question: What is the length of line segment RU?

Let's start by looking at the diagram:

In this diagram, we can see that:

* Line segment RS has length 5.
* Line segment RT has length 17.
* Line segment ST has length 22.
* Point U is the midpoint of line segment ST.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the length of line segment RU. Since U is the midpoint of ST, we know that the distance from U to S is equal to the distance from U to T. Therefore, we can set up two equations based on the distances:

Equation 1:
Distance from U to S = Distance from U to T

Equation 2:
Distance from U to S + Distance from U to T = Distance from R to T (since RT is a straight line)

Now, we can substitute the lengths of the line segments into Equation 1:

Distance from U to S = 5 + 17 = 22

And into Equation 2:

Distance from U to S + Distance from U to T = 22 + 17 = 39

Now, we can solve for the length of line segment RU by using Equation 2:

Length of RU = 39 - 5 = 34

Therefore, the length of line segment RU is 34.

So, the correct answer is:

A wire in the shape of rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side?,"{'A': 'A)9', 'B': 'B)11', 'C': 'C)22', 'D': 'D)25', 'E': 'E)31'}",C," Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!

To find the measure of each side of the square, we need to use the fact that the perimeter of a rectangle is equal to the sum of the lengths of all its sides. Since the wire is rebent to form a square, the perimeter of the square will be equal to the perimeter of the original rectangle.

The perimeter of the original rectangle is given as 27 cm + 17 cm = 44 cm.

Now, we know that the perimeter of a square is equal to the side length of the square times four. So, we can set up the equation:

44 cm = 4(side length)

Solving for the side length, we get:

So, the professors borrowed Rs. 5000 from the university at simple interest. After 3 years, the university got Rs. 300 on interest.

First, we need to find out how much interest the university received in 3 years. To do this, we can use the formula for simple interest:

Interest = Principal x Rate x Time

In this case, the principal is Rs. 5000, the rate is the interest rate per annum (we'll figure out what that is later), and the time is 3 years.

So, the interest would be:

Interest = Rs. 5000 x Rate x 3

Now, we know that the university received Rs. 300 on interest. So, we can set up an equation based on this information:

Rs. 5000 x Rate x 3 = Rs. 300

Next, we need to solve for the rate. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by the principal (Rs. 5000):

Rate x 3 = Rs. 300 / Rs. 5000

Now, we can simplify:

Rate x 3 = 0.06

To find out what this rate is as a percentage, we can multiply by 100:

Rate = 0.06 x 100

Rate = 6%

So, the rate of interest per annum is 6%.

Now, let's look at the options:

Here's how we can approach it:

Let's say the number of boys who joined the group is x. Since the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, the number of girls who joined the group is 3x.

We know that the total number of members who joined the group is equal to the sum of the number of boys and girls, so we can set up the equation:

x + 3x = ?

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4x = ?

Now, we need to find the value of x that satisfies this equation. To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = ?

So, the number of boys who joined the group is x, and the number of girls who joined the group is 3x. Since there are 64 boys and 40 girls in the original group, we know that:

x + 3x = 64 + 40

Simplifying, we get:

4x = 104

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:

x = 26

So, there are 26 boys in the group. Since the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, there are 3 times as many girls as boys, or 26 \* 3 = 78 girls.

Therefore, the total number of members in the group is 26 + 78 = 104. The correct answer is option B: 288.",B,False,5.56313157081604

Step 1: Travel from M to N (3 buses)

There are 3 buses available from M to N, so we have 3 options:

A) Take the first bus from M to N.
B) Take the second bus from M to N.
C) Take the third bus from M to N.

Each option has a different number of buses available, but they all lead to the same destination (N). So, we have 3 options in total.

Step 2: Travel from N to O (4 buses)

Once we reach N, we have 4 buses available to take us to O. Again, we have 4 options:

A) Take the first bus from N to O.
B) Take the second bus from N to O.
C) Take the third bus from N to O.
D) Take the fourth bus from N to O.

Each option has a different number of buses available, but they all lead to the same destination (O). So, we have 4 options in total.

Step 3: Travel from O to P (1 bus)

Now we have only one bus available to take us from O to P. We have one option:

A) Take the only bus from O to P.

Step 4: Travel from P to Q (3 buses)

Finally, we have 3 buses available to take us from P to Q. We have 3 options:

A) Take the first bus from P to Q.
B) Take the second bus from P to Q.
C) Take the third bus from P to Q.

Each option has a different number of buses available, but they all lead to the same destination (Q). So, we have 3 options in total.

The question states that the man rows at a rate of 4 kmph in still water, which means he can cover a distance of 4 km in one hour.

Now, if he is rowing against a current, his rate will be slower than 4 kmph. The question tells us that his rate against the current is 2 kmph, so he will cover a distance of 2 km in one hour.

To find out the man's rate along the current, we need to know the distance he can cover in one hour. We know that he can cover 2 km in one hour against the current, so his rate along the current is:

1. The worker drives from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour.
2. To find out how long it takes the worker to drive from home to work, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Rate

In this case, the distance is 9 minutes (since the worker drives for 9 minutes), and the rate is 20 kilometers per hour.

So, we can plug in the values and solve for time:

Time = 9 minutes / 20 kilometers/hour

Time = 0.45 hours (or 45 minutes)

1. Now, let's find out how long it would take the worker to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour.
2. Again, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Rate

In this case, the distance is the same as before (9 minutes), and the rate is now 6 kilometers per hour.

First, we know that the company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, so the total production cost per month is:

420 units x $110 per unit = $46,200 per month

Since the company sells all of the components by the end of each month, we can assume that the revenue from sales per month is also $46,200.

Now, let's look at the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs):

Yearly profit = 12 months x $46,200 per month - $46,200 per month

Yearly profit = $554,400

So, we need to find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400. To do this, we can set up an equation:

Minimum selling price per component = Yearly profit / Number of components produced per month

Substituting the values we have, we get:

Minimum selling price per component = $554,400 / 420 units per month

Minimum selling price per component = $1,326.40

1. The man has Rs 8600 to distribute among his children and nephews.
2. Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew.
3. Each son receives five times as much as each nephew.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find out how much each daughter receives. We know that each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so if we can find out how much each nephew receives, we can multiply that amount by 4 to find out how much each daughter receives.

Let's assume that each nephew receives x rupees. Then, we can say that each daughter receives 4x rupees.

Now, let's think about the sons. We know that each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so if we can find out how much each nephew receives, we can multiply that amount by 5 to find out how much each son receives.

So, we have two equations:

1. Each daughter receives 4x rupees.
2. Each son receives 5x rupees.

Now, let's solve for x. We can do this by subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

20% of x = 20x/100

Since 28% of the students took math, we can write:

28% of x = 28x/100

We also know that 501 students took at least one of these subjects (physics or math). So we can set up an inequality based on this information:

Given:

* The average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x.
* The average score for the entire class is equal to y.
* There are z students in the class, where z > 5.

Question: What is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?

Let's start by analyzing the given information:

1. The average of the highest and lowest scores is equal to x. This means that the highest score and the lowest score are both greater than or equal to x.
2. The average score for the entire class is equal to y. This means that the sum of all the scores in the class is equal to y times the number of students in the class (zy).
3. There are z students in the class, where z > 5. This means that there are more than five students in the class.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers. One way to do this is to subtract the highest and lowest scores from the total score of the class, and then divide by the number of students in the class minus two (since there are more than five students in the class).

So, let's try to write an equation that represents the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers:

Let's use 'C' as the variable for the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers.

We know that the sum of all the scores in the class is equal to y times the number of students in the class (zy):

zy = y(z)

Since there are more than five students in the class, we can subtract the highest and lowest scores from the total score of the class:

zy - 2x = y(z) - 2x

Now, let's divide by the number of students in the class minus two (since there are more than five students in the class):

zy - 2x / (z - 2) = (y - 2x) / (z - 2)

This is the equation for the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers.

1. The ship traveled 180 miles.
2. A plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship.

So, if the ship traveled 180 miles in x hours, the plane will travel 1800 miles (10x) in the same amount of time.

Let's say the plane starts at the same point as the ship (the starting point). Then, after some time, they will meet.

Now, we need to find out when they meet. We can do this by setting up a proportion:

180 miles / x hours = 1800 miles / y hours

where x is the time it takes for the ship to travel 180 miles, and y is the time it takes for the plane to travel 1800 miles.

We know that the ship traveled 180 miles in x hours, so we can substitute x = 3 (since there are 3 hours in each mile).

Substituting this into the proportion above, we get:

180 miles / 3 hours = 1800 miles / y hours

Now, we need to solve for y. To do this, we can divide both sides of the proportion by 1800:

y hours = (1800 miles) / (180 miles / 3 hours)

y hours = 3 x 180 miles / 1800 miles

y hours = 6 hours

So, it will take the plane 6 hours to travel 1800 miles. Since they both start at the same point, they will meet after 6 hours.

Now, let's find out how far they will be from the starting point when they meet. We know that the ship traveled 180 miles in 3 hours, so we can calculate the distance they will be from the starting point:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 180 miles/3 hours
= 60 miles per hour

Since they will meet after 6 hours, they will be 60 miles x 6 hours = 360 miles from the starting point.

So, the correct answer is:

C) 360 miles

Given:

* Ram and Krishna start from A and B, respectively, at the same time.
* They travel towards each other at constant speeds of 20m/s and 40m/s, respectively.
* Ram meets Krishna at point C on the road after 10 seconds.

Let's start by identifying what we know:

1. The distance between A and B is the same as the distance between B and A (since they are both traveling at constant speeds).
2. The distance between A and C is equal to the distance between B and C, since Ram meets Krishna at point C.
3. The time taken by Ram to reach point C is 10 seconds.

Here's how we can approach it:

Let's start by identifying what we know:

1. The electric pole is 14 meters high.
2. The shadow of the electric pole is 10 meters long.
3. We want to find the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 meters under similar conditions.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to solve the problem. Since the shadow of the electric pole is 10 meters long, we know that the angle of the shadow is equal to the angle of elevation of the sun. This means that if the sun were directly overhead, the shadow would be at its maximum length (10 meters).

Now, let's consider the height of the tree. We know that the height of the tree must be greater than 14 meters (the height of the electric pole) in order to cast a shadow of 15 meters. But we also know that the angle of elevation of the sun is equal to the angle of depression of the object (tree in this case), so if the tree were 15 meters high, the angle of elevation of the sun would be 15/14 = 1.07 (approximately).

This means that the height of the tree must be greater than 14 meters, but not by too much. In other words, the tree must be around 15-16 meters high.

So, the correct answer is:

C) 20 meters

The tree must be at least 20 meters high to cast a shadow of 15 meters under similar conditions.",C,False,5.619404315948486

Step 1: Identify the letters in each row and column of the table.

From the first row, we have:

M A D

From the second row, we have:

B E

From the third row, we have:

A M I D

Step 2: Look for patterns or clues in each row and column that might help us decipher the table.

Let's start with the first row:

M A D

The letter ""M"" appears twice, which suggests that it might be a factor in the multiplication problem. The letter ""A"" also appears twice, and the letter ""D"" appears once.

Now let's look at the second row:

B E

The letter ""B"" appears twice, and the letter ""E"" appears once. There doesn't seem to be any obvious pattern here.

Finally, let's examine the third row:

A M I D

The letter ""A"" appears three times, and the letter ""I"" appears once. The letter ""D"" also appears once.

Step 3: Use the patterns and clues we've identified to start solving the multiplication problems.

Let's begin by looking at the first row:

M A D

We know that ""M"" is a factor, so let's try multiplying ""M"" by each of the other letters in the row:

M x A = 9 (since ""A"" appears twice)
M x D = 7 (since ""D"" appears once)

Now let's move on to the second row:

B E

We don't see any obvious patterns here, so let's try multiplying each letter by every other letter in the row:

B x E = 2 (since ""E"" appears once)

Finally, let's look at the third row:

A M I D

We know that ""A"" is a factor, so let's try multiplying ""A"" by each of the other letters in the row:

A x M = 9 (since ""M"" appears twice)
A x I = 2 (since ""I"" appears once)
A x D = 7 (since ""D"" appears once)

Step 4: Use the results of our multiplication problems to decipher the table.

Now that we have the results of our multiplication problems, let's see if we can use them to decipher the table. Here's what we know so far:

M A D

M x A = 9
M x D = 7

B E

B x E = 2

A M I D

A x M = 9
A x I = 2
A x D = 7

Using this information, we can start filling in the blanks in the table. For example, we know that ""M"" is a factor of ""A D"", so we can fill in the blank as follows:

M A D

M x A = 9
M x D = 7

We also know that ""B"" is a factor of ""E"", so we can fill in the blank as follows:

B E

B x E = 2

And we know that ""A"" is a factor of ""I D"", so we can fill in the blank as follows:

A M I D

A x M = 9
A x I = 2
A x D = 7

Now let's take a look at the completed table:

M A D

M x A = 9
M x D = 7

Population after one year = 81900
Increase = 5% of 81900
Increase = 0.05 x 81900

From the information given, we know that:

* One gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E (so 1 gram provides 0.09 x 100% = 9% of the daily requirement)
* One gram of the health food contains 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A (so 1 gram provides 0.08 x 100% = 8% of the daily requirement)

We also know that we need to provide at least the minimum daily requirements of both vitamins E and A.

So, to calculate how many grams of the health food we need to eat daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirements of both vitamins, we need to first calculate the minimum daily requirements of each vitamin:

* Vitamin E: 9% of the daily requirement is provided in 1 gram of the health food, so the daily requirement is 100% / 0.09 = 11.11 times the amount provided in 1 gram (i.e., 11.11 x 9% = 99.99% of the daily requirement)
* Vitamin A: 8% of the daily requirement is provided in 1 gram of the health food, so the daily requirement is 100% / 0.08 = 12.5 times the amount provided in 1 gram (i.e., 12.5 x 8% = 100% of the daily requirement)

Now we can calculate how many grams of the health food we need to eat daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirements of both vitamins:

* Vitamin E: We need to provide at least 99.99% of the daily requirement, so we need to eat at least 11.11 grams of the health food per day (since 1 gram provides 9% of the daily requirement)

Step 1: Identify the given information and the task at hand.

* The problem states that each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour.
* We need to prepare 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes in total.
* We have 3 hours available for preparation.

Step 2: Determine the number of large cakes that can be made in 3 hours.

* Each helper can make 2 large cakes per hour, so we can make a total of 6 large cakes in 3 hours (2 x 3 = 6).

Step 3: Determine the number of small cakes that can be made in 3 hours.

* Each helper can make 35 small cakes per hour, so we can make a total of 105 small cakes in 3 hours (35 x 3 = 105).

Step 4: Add the number of large and small cakes that can be made to determine the total number of cakes that can be prepared.

* 6 large cakes + 105 small cakes = 111 cakes (6 + 105 = 111)

Step 5: Compare the total number of cakes that can be prepared to the number of cakes needed.

* We need 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes, but we can only prepare 111 cakes in total.

Therefore, we need more helpers to prepare all the cakes within the given time frame. Let's analyze the options:

Option A: 8 helpers

* Each helper can make 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour, so we can make a total of 16 large cakes and 280 small cakes in 3 hours (2 x 8 = 16, 35 x 8 = 280).

Given:

* 2/3 of a number is subtracted by 10.
* The result is equal to the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number.

Let's start by analyzing the given information:

1. 2/3 of a number is subtracted by 10. This means we need to find out what 2/3 of a number is, and then subtract 10 from it.
2. The result is equal to the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number. This gives us two pieces of information:
	* The sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number.
	* The fact that the result is equal to this sum.

Now, let's think about how we can use these clues to find the number. Here's a step-by-step approach:

Step 1: Find out what 2/3 of a number is.

We know that 2/3 of a number is equal to 2 multiplied by 3, which gives us:

2 x 3 = 6

So, 2/3 of a number is equal to 6.

Step 2: Subtract 10 from 6.

When we subtract 10 from 6, we get:

6 - 10 = -4

Step 3: Find the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number.

We know that the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number is equal to the result of subtracting 10 from 2/3 of a number. So, we can set up an equation:

40 + (1/3)x = -4

where x is the unknown number.

Step 4: Solve for x.

To solve for x, we can first simplify the fraction:

(1/3)x = 40 / 3

This gives us:

(1/3)x = 133

Now, we can substitute this value into the equation:

40 + (1/3)x = -4

Substituting x = 133, we get:

40 + 133 = -4

This simplifies to:

173 = -4

To find the difference between simple interest and compound interest at the same rate for Rs.5000 for 2 years, we need to first calculate the simple interest and compound interest separately.

Simple Interest:
The formula for simple interest is:
SI = PRT
where SI is the simple interest, P is the principal amount (Rs.5000 in this case), R is the rate of interest (we'll find out what it is later), and T is the time period (2 years in this case).

So, SI = Rs.5000 x 2 x 10% = Rs.1000

Compound Interest:
The formula for compound interest is:
CI = P(1 + r/n)^(nT) - P
where CI is the compound interest, P is the principal amount (Rs.5000 in this case), r is the rate of interest (we'll find out what it is later), n is the number of times the interest is compounded per year (we'll assume it's 1 since we're dealing with a 2-year period), and T is the time period (2 years in this case).

So, CI = Rs.5000 x (1 + 10%/1)^(2 x 2) - Rs.5000
= Rs.5000 x (1 + 10%)^4 - Rs.5000
= Rs.5000 x 1.10^4 - Rs.5000
= Rs.72

Now, we can see that the difference between the simple interest and compound interest is Rs.72. So, the rate of interest must be 10%.

Sachin's current age = 40

Now we need to find out Ajay's current age. We can do this by using the information from the problem:

Ajay's age 10 years ago = Sachin's age 10 years ago / 2
